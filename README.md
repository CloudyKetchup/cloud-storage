# CloudStorage
First attempt creating a file storage for self usage, at that time I was not enough experienced and did a LOT of mistakes and caused even more issues

Now it's archived and I will never come back here, with my new knowledge and skills I'm planning of creating a new file storage, with modern tehnologies and scalable architecture, and that will be in future, don't know exactly when.
